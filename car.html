                    Everything that happened throughout the series makes sence once you watch that last episode.I bet you will get goosebumps once you realise the genius twist they had planned all this while.
                    
                    Nobita returns from his school, crying to Doraemon for he had been bullied by Gian yet again. He finds out that Doraemon is not moving. He uses his time tv to call Doraemi and find out whats wrong.
                    
                    She tells him that his battery has died which can be only solved by technology that exists in the future. But for some reason the future government had ceased any time travel from that era, for ever and there is actually not anything that can be done. </dd>
